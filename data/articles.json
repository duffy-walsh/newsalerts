High prices due to soaring inflation and fewer shipments of coronavirus vaccines also played a role. The deficit rose from a revised $81.9 billion in December, which was also an all-time high. Last year, the U.S. posted the highest trade deficit ever. The record gap mostly stemmed from the U.S. recovering faster than other countries. Imports have surged while the growth in American exports has lagged behind.",

This exchange made plain a new reality: We are no longer dressing just for in-person soirées and IRL eyes but for the digital realm—an array of small screens blasting our every outfit to hundreds (or thousands—even millions) of followers, from friends and family to co-workers, bosses, potential love interests and complete strangers.",

Ainsi, les observateurs de tout l'éventail politique utilisent des expressions telles que « se tirer une balle dans le pied » pour décrire la confrontation diplomatique des États-Unis avec la Russie et leurs alliés.",

The announcement sent Amazon shares up more than 6% in intraday trading Thursday, to more than $2,900 each. Stock splits usually happen when the price of a company's shares has gotten very high. In a stock split, a company divides up its shares to lower their price and increase the overall amount of shares available.",

Oil is now roughly double its early December low.Risking even higher U.S. fuel prices, President Joe Biden on Tuesday imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine, amid strong support from American voters and lawmakers.",

  "summary": "The stock market was having a very strong day on Wednesday following a multiday slump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were both higher by about 2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was higher by about 3% as of 10:40 a.m. ET.\nHowever, lending-technology company Upstart ( UPST 2.96% ) was a major outperformer. Shares were trading higher by nearly 8% after rising by as much as 10% earlier in the day. Clearly, much of today's move can be attributed to market momentum. Other major fintech companies such as PayPal and Block were significantly higher, as well.",

(AP) — Last year, Virginia lawmakers passed one of the most restrictive bans in the country on the use of facial recognition technology, barring local police departments and campus police from purchasing or using the technology unless explicitly authorized by the legislature.On Thursday, just eight months after the ban took effect, lawmakers approved a bill to lift the blanket ban. The legislation would allow police agencies to use the technology in certain circumstances, including to help identify an individual when they have reasonable suspicion that the person committed a crime.",

These are conservative figures, as an estimated half of all SRCs go unreported. SRCs can damage brain tissue and result in a number of debilitating symptoms that affect cognition, sleep, balance and gait. The severity of the injury and recovery time following an SRC can range widely—some individuals recover within days, while others experience symptoms for months.",

Scott Surovell (D-VA) said the technology, when used appropriately, can be a valuable tool for solving and prosecuting crimes more efficiently.\nSome lawmakers opposed lifting the ban, raising issues about privacy, civil rights violations, and research indicating facial recognition software generates higher error rates when used to identify people of color.",

A stock split is a cosmetic change: it merely breaks each share into smaller pieces without affecting its fundamental value. But nevertheless, stock prices tend to react positively to the announcement of a split, as investors accept the common argument that lower prices make the individual shares more attractive and accessible smaller retail investors.",

  "summary": "On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by 60 points. With the possibility of the U.S. banning Russian oil imports as soon as Tuesday, it has triggered a surge in oil prices. The ban, however, is likely without European participation as Europe relies heavily on Russian energy production. Europe also relies on Russia for natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products in light of Russia's recent aggression on Ukraine.\n\nShell (NYSE: SHEL) stock was up by over 2% on today's opening bell after it apologized for buying a shipment of Russian oil.",

We expect the relative outperformance of real assets to continue based on: 1) persistently high inflation; 2) deeply negative real rates; 3) geopolitical tensions; 4) the chances of a Fed policy error as it attempts to combat inflation; and 5) the structural supply side issues associated with transition from traditional to renewable energy sources.",

Year-to-date, the VanEck Inflation Allocation ETF (RAAX) is outperforming the S&P 500® Index by nearly 20%. We expect the relative outperformance of real assets to continue based on: 1) persistently high inflation; 2) deeply negative real rates; 3) geopolitical tensions; 4) the chances of a Fed policy error as it attempts to combat inflation; and 5) the structural supply side issues associated with transition from traditional to renewable energy sources.",
